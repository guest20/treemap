treemap
=======

This project was created to visualize data with treemaping algorithms in objective-c for Mac OS X (Pivot by middle, 
Slice and dice, Strip, Squarified, Split).
Open and run project in Xcode on Mac OS X. Choose algorithm from list and data file you want to visualize. If you do
not have right data file choose one of the default below. Then in other window you will see the effect of the algorithm.
This project works with ordered directories written by Brandon McQuilkin. You can find it on gihub:
